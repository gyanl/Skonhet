      <p>Unobtrusive, comfortably sequestered yet eloquent in their style statement ... thats how our tower lamps define themselves. Tower lamps are ideal for recesses, corners and unutilized spaces. Lightweight by design, our floor and tower lamps are easy to move around as you might change your layouts with time and taste.</p>
      <p>All our lighting products, as indeed tower lamps, take pride in low energy consumption, aesthetic luminescence and sturdiness. The samples are categorized under design segments ranging from geometric to floral. A lamp's design also lends to its luminosity ie, the % surface area available for light diffusion as a measure of the surface area of the face of the lamp. The floor lamps shown below having varying luminosities deriving directly from their respective designs.</p>

        <p>The tower lamps have a standard height of around 4 ft, a body measuring approximately 6 in x 6 in and use galvanized steel, paper / acrylic to express themselves.</p>

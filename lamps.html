        <p>All our lighting products, as indeed tower lamps, take pride in low energy consumption, aesthetic luminescence and sturdiness. The products are categorized under design segments ranging from geometric to floral. A lamp's design also lends to its luminosity ie, the % surface area available for light diffusion as a measure of the surface area of the face of the lamp.
        </p>
        <p>We do believe that design is inherent in and innate to every individual and in that spirit would be more than happy to hear out your ideas and designs and give them a tangible form.

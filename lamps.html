        <p>All our lighting products take pride in low energy consumption, aesthetic luminescence and sturdiness. The products are categorized under design segments ranging from geometric to floral. A lamp's design also lends to its luminosity ie, the % surface area available for light diffusion as a measure of the surface area of the face of the lamp.
        </p>
        <p>We do believe that design is inherent in and innate to every individual and in that spirit would be more than happy to hear out your ideas and designs and give them a tangible form.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pride ourselves in customizing products to indivudual requirements and would be very pleased to hear from you how we can adapt these lamps and lights according to your taste and requirement.
